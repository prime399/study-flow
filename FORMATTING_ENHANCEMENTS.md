# AI Chat Formatting Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the AI chatbot's text formatting capabilities to provide better readability and support for programming content, moving away from table-heavy responses to rich markdown formatting.

## Changes Made

### 1. System Prompt Improvements (`app/api/ai-helper/_lib/system-prompt.ts`)
- **Markdown Guidance**: Added comprehensive instructions for AI models to use proper markdown formatting
- **Code Block Support**: Instructed AI to use language-specific syntax highlighting
- **Structured Formatting**: Guidelines for using headings, lists, blockquotes, and inline code
- **Programming Focus**: Special instructions for handling programming questions with best practices
- **Optional Tables**: Changed tables from mandatory to optional (only when comparing items with specific attributes)

Key formatting instructions now include:
- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Use `inline code` for commands and variables
- Use code blocks with language identifiers (python, javascript, etc.)
- Use numbered lists for steps
- Use bullet points for general lists
- Use blockquotes (>) for important notes
- Use headings (###) for organization

### 2. Enhanced Markdown Components (`app/(protected)/dashboard/ai-helper/_components/markdown-components.tsx`)
Added full heading support:
- `h1` through `h6` with responsive sizing and proper spacing
- Border bottom on h1 and h2 for better visual hierarchy
- Responsive text sizes for mobile and desktop

Improved styling for:
- **Code blocks**: Dark theme with syntax highlighting, shadows, and borders
- **Inline code**: Pink accent color with distinct background and border
- **Blockquotes**: Blue accent with background tint for tips and notes
- **Horizontal rules**: Proper spacing
- **Links**: Blue color with hover effects
- **Strong/Emphasis**: Enhanced contrast

### 3. Enhanced CSS Styles (`app/globals.css`)
Added comprehensive styles including:
- **Better spacing**: Improved line height and margins for readability
- **Code blocks**: Dark zinc background (zinc-900/zinc-950) with proper padding and borders
- **Syntax highlighting**: Full color scheme for multiple programming languages
  - Keywords: Purple
  - Strings: Emerald
  - Numbers: Orange
  - Comments: Muted gray with italics
  - Variables: Cyan
  - Types: Yellow
  - Built-ins: Blue
  - Tags: Pink
  - Operators: Light gray
  - Regex: Red
- **Blockquotes**: Blue accent bar with background tint
- **Lists**: Better spacing and nesting support
- **Tables**: Improved spacing when used

### 4. Vercel Production Fix (`app/api/ai-helper/route.ts`)
Fixed MCP tools fetch issue on Vercel:
- Changed from hardcoded `localhost:3000` to use actual request URL
- Gracefully skips MCP tools if endpoint not available
- Works with production domain (e.g., https://study-flow.tech)

## Benefits

1. **Better Code Readability**: Programming code now displays with proper syntax highlighting in a dark theme
2. **Improved Scannability**: Headings, lists, and spacing make responses easier to scan
3. **Context-Aware Formatting**: Inline code, code blocks, and blockquotes help distinguish different types of content
4. **Mobile Responsive**: All formatting scales properly on mobile devices
5. **Less Table Overuse**: Tables only used when actually beneficial, not forced for every response
6. **Professional Appearance**: Modern syntax highlighting and styling similar to popular code editors

## Technical Details

### Supported Languages for Syntax Highlighting
The enhancement supports all languages that highlight.js supports, including:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- Go
- Rust
- Ruby
- PHP
- HTML/CSS
- SQL
- Shell/Bash
- And many more...

### Dark Mode Support
All enhancements include proper dark mode variants with:
- Appropriate contrast ratios
- Consistent color schemes
- Better readability in both light and dark themes

## Testing Recommendations

Test the AI chat with various query types:
1. **Programming questions**: "How do I implement a binary search in Python?"
2. **Step-by-step instructions**: "How do I set up a React project?"
3. **Explanations with code**: "Explain async/await in JavaScript"
4. **Comparisons**: "Compare REST vs GraphQL" (should use table)
5. **General questions**: "How can I improve my study habits?"

Each should now display with appropriate formatting that enhances readability.
